There are algorithms for searching,delete and add data from different data stuctures 

# Exercise11.c
Serial Search 
  - First function = Search for a element in the pointer that is equal with a key 
  - Second function = Search for all the elements in the pointer that is equal with a key 

# Exercise12.c
Searial Searche Vs Binary Search

# Exercise13.c
Brute Force Search

# Exercise21.c
  - Recursive function for sum of digits
